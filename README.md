#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintan high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintanance of software products

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960
3. Advent of structured programming in the 1970
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Includes;
1. requirements - Gathering high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
2. Implementation - writing code and building the software according to the design specification
3. Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
4. Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers
5. Maintanance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g., requierments, design and implementation flowing downwars like a waterfall while agile methodology refers to an interative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer is responsible for writing code and implmenting software solution using programming language of choice
2. Quality assurance engineer - Ensures software quality by desigining and executing test plans
3. Project manager - He or she overseees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important software suits as they provide comprehensinve tools for wring, debugging and testing code 
VCs e.g., Git is used for source code management by tracking changes to source code and cordingating work among team members


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on schedule can results in rushed development and compromised quality
2. Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt impeds future development efforts and increase maintanance costs
3. Changing requirements - Requirements may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing - Testing individual components or modules of software
2. Integration testing - testing interactions betweeen different components or subsystems
3. System testing - testing the entier software system as a whole
4. Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requierments to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Refers to crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from an AI NLP model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: How can i make Chapatis?
Improved prompt: Give me a step by step detailed recipe on how to make chapatis using ingredients Wheatfloor water and oil?
The improved prompt is better because
1. It is clear the NLP model should provide a step by step recipe
2. Has keywords recipe, chapatis and ingredients availabe to make chapati
3. It has context by provideing the ingredients availabe the model will provide recipe on those ingredients to actualize a chapati
